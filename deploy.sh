# Deploy ESMira (this fork — incl. the web-push backend) to a VPS.
#
# Usage: ./deploy.sh [HOST]      HOST defaults to surrey-vps.
#
# Unlike the upstream docker-compose (which pulls jodlidev/esmira:latest), this
# builds an image FROM THIS REPO's Dockerfile on the server, so our backend
# (api/push_*.php, backend/notifications/*, cli/*, composer web-push, cron) and
# the participant PWA are what actually run.
#
# Safe by design: data/config live in bind-mounted volumes that are never
# touched; the server docker-compose.yml is backed up before its image line is
# repointed. Rollback = restore the .bak compose and `docker compose up -d`.
#
# Deploy guard: every successful deploy records its exact commit in
# $REMOTE_DIR/DEPLOYED_SHA on the server. Before building, we read it back and
# REFUSE to ship unless that live commit is an ancestor of HEAD (i.e. we are
# strictly ahead of live) — this catches "shipping a stale local while live is
# ahead", the exact regression a bare version number can't see. Each deploy also
# auto-bumps package.json's PATCH so dist/VERSION + the injected PACKAGE_VERSION
# advance (PWA/bundle cache-bust + a visible "what's live" marker); minor/major
# stay reserved for intentional releases.
#
# Env overrides: DEPLOY_SKIP_GUARD=1 (bypass ancestry check — emergencies),
# DEPLOY_ALLOW_DIRTY=1 (ship an uncommitted tree), DEPLOY_NO_BUMP=1 (don't bump),
# DEPLOY_PUSH=1 (git push HEAD to origin after a successful deploy).
