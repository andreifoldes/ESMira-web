# Fork divergence from upstream

This page is the map of *what is different* from
[`KL-Psychological-Methodology/ESMira-web`](https://github.com/KL-Psychological-Methodology/ESMira-web).
Each row links to the page that documents the feature.

## The numbers (as of 2026-10-06)

| Measure | Value |
| --- | --- |
| Fork base (last common upstream commit) | upstream `3.6.2`, 2026-06-05 |
| Fork commits since base | 136 (59 of them `feat`) |
| First / latest fork commit | 2026-06-17 / 2026-09-08 |
| Size of the change | about 163 files, +29.6k / −0.5k lines |
| Fork version at this date | `3.6.16` |
| Upstream at this date | `3.7.2` (24 commits ahead of the fork base) |

:::warning[The fork has not merged upstream since forking]
Upstream moved from `3.6.2` to `3.7.2`. The upstream delta is small (about 17 files) but touches files the fork
also edits (`Study.ts`, `Questionnaire.ts`, `qEdit.tsx`, `filterTrigger.tsx`, `triggerEdit.tsx`,
`inputEdit.tsx`, locales), so expect merge conflicts.
Upstream changes the fork **lacks**: reward-amount calculation with currency setting, AM/PM time-input
fixes, chart-variable cleanup when deleting inputs, and some translation fixes.

## What the fork adds

### Participant PWA (entirely new)

Upstream's participant UI is a Mithril web client with no scheduling. The fork adds a separate React app in
`web-pwa/`, served at `/pwa/`.

## Known documentation drift in the repo

- `web-pwa/README.md` is **out of date**. It still says the PWA makes "no backend changes" and lists push,
  scheduled prompts, wearables and voice as not included. All of those now exist. This site supersedes it.
- The root `README.md` and `CHANGELOG.md` are still upstream's. The fork does not maintain a changelog;
  its history is only in `git log`.

## Inherited, unchanged

Everything not listed above is upstream ESMira: the data model, the designer, statistics and charts,
accounts and permissions, the `datasets.php` ingest endpoint, rewards, messaging, the plugin API and the
fallback-server system. The [backend overview](./backend/overview.md) summarises these basics.
