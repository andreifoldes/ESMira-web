# CI and release

## Workflows

| Workflow | Trigger | Origin | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `auto_release.yml` | push to `main`, manual | upstream (arm64 edit) | Builds the legacy ESMira bundle (`npm run prod`), **auto-tags** `vX.Y.Z` from root `package.json`, zips `dist/`, creates a GitHub release, builds and pushes a multi-arch Docker image. Release and Docker steps run only when a **new tag** is created and need Docker Hub secrets. |
| `auto_prerelease.yml` | push to `develop` | upstream | Same, with the `pre.` tag prefix. The fork has no `develop` branch. |
| `update_parent.yml` | push to `main` | upstream | Bumps submodules in the upstream parent repository. **Fails on every fork push** because the required secret does not exist; harmless but noisy. |
| `accessibility.yml` | release published, manual | fork | WCAG 2.2 axe audit of the PWA. See [Accessibility](../pwa/accessibility.md). |
| `docs.yml` | `website/**` changes, manual | fork | Builds and deploys this site to GitHub Pages; scans the built HTML for private details. |
| `security-audit.yml` | push, pull request, weekly, manual | fork | gitleaks plus the private-detail scanner. See [Security audit](./security-audit.md). |

The new workflows use their own concurrency groups (`docs-*`, `pages`, `security-audit-*`) and never touch
`dist/` or `package.json`, so they cannot trigger an auto-tag.

## `deploy.sh` and `ship.sh`

`deploy.sh` is the fork's production path. In order:

1. **Heal** iCloud-style git conflict copies (`git-heal.sh`) and verify the object graph.
2. **Guard:** the working tree must be clean, and the revision already deployed on the server must be an
   ancestor of `HEAD` (stops a stale checkout overwriting newer work).
3. **Bump** the patch version (`npm version patch --no-git-tag-version`).
4. **Build** everything: `npm run build:all` (ESMira webpack, then the PWA).
5. **Accessibility gate:** the axe audit must pass.
6. **Commit** `chore(release): vX.Y.Z` (only `package.json` and the lockfile).
7. **Sync** the build to the host and **rebuild and restart** the container; generate VAPID keys if missing;
   record the deployed revision.

`ship.sh` is `deploy.sh` followed by `git push origin`, so the code on `origin` never gets ahead of what was
verified and shipped. Environment overrides exist for emergencies (`DEPLOY_SKIP_GUARD`, `DEPLOY_ALLOW_DIRTY`,
`DEPLOY_NO_BUMP`, `A11Y_SKIP`, `A11Y_FAIL_ON`, and so on).

The host, remote directory and credentials are configured outside the public docs; they are deliberately not
described here.

## Versioning

- The root `package.json` version is the release version (`3.6.16` at 2026-10-06), shown on the PWA's About
  screen.
- Patch bumps happen automatically on each deploy (14 `chore(release)` commits from `v3.6.3` to `v3.6.16`).
  Minor and major bumps are manual.
- A push to `main` that changes the version makes `auto_release.yml` create the tag and release.
- `CHANGELOG.md` is upstream's stub and is **not maintained** by the fork. Release history lives in
  `git log`.

## Conventions

Commits follow Conventional Commits (`feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `chore`, `test`, with scopes such as `pwa`,
`push`, `study`, `invite`, `deploy`).

## Tests

| Suite | Command |
| --- | --- |
| PWA unit tests (availability, relevance, keystrokes, other-specify) | `cd web-pwa && npm test` |
| PWA type check | `cd web-pwa && npm run lint` |
| Accessibility audit | `npm run a11y` |
| Security scanner rules | `node --test scripts/security/scan-private-details.test.mjs` |
| Docs build | `cd website && npm run build` |
| Backend (PHP) | `test/` (not covered by CI) |

<span className="status status--tbc">TBC</span> The PWA service worker, `esmiraApi.ts` and UI components have
no automated tests, and the fork's backend additions have no PHP tests.
